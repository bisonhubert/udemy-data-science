Section 12: Probability - Distributions

- Fundamentals Of
  - Distribution: The possible values a variable can take and how frequently they occur
    - Two characteristics: mean (µ) and variance (σ^2). There is a constant relationship between the two.
    - Mean
      - average value
      - symbol: µ "mu" (typed by holding option and typing "m")
    - Variance
      - how spread out the data is. The more dispersed, the higher the variance
      - symbol: σ^2 "sigma squared"
    - Relationship
      - "sigma squared = the expected value of Y - mu squared"
      - σ^2 = E((Y - µ)^2) == E(Y^2) - µ^2
  - Probabilities: Measure the likelihood of an outcome (with finite number of possible outcomes)
  - Notation
    - Probability function: p(y)
      - Y -> the actual outcome of an event
      - y -> one of the possible outcomes
      - P (Y = y) -> one way to denote the likelihood of a particular outcome
      - P (y) -> shorthand for above
      - Ex: Y is the number of red marbles in a bag. y -> 5 represents five marbles from the bag. Probability of getting exactly 5 red marbles is P(Y=5) == P(5)
    - sample mean vs sample variance
    - a constant relationship 
- Types of Probability Distributions
- Discrete Distributions
- DD: The Uniform Distribution
- DD: The Bernoulli Distribution
- DD: The Binomial Distribution
- DD: The Poisson Distrubution
- Continuous Distributions

Section 11: Probability - Bayesian Inference

- Overview: Describing events and how they interact with one another
  - An event leads to a set of outcomes
  - Ex1 (numerical): The event of a 6-sided die roll being even has the favorable outcomes, or set: 2, 4, and 6
  - Ex2 (non-numerical): Being a member of the EU. France and Germany are values in this set. USA and Japan are not
  - Expressing sets and values: Sets use upper-case letters, values are lower. So X is the set, x and x and x are values in it
  - Null set: an empty set
- Ways Sets Can Interact
  - Visual aids and graphs help identify these interactions
  - Events as circles, values as circles contained in the event circle
  - Event circles have 3 interaction varieties. They can never touch, intersect, or completely overlap
  - Mutually exclusive events: The two events can never happen simultaneously. If Event A is occuring, event B is not occuring
    - Ex1: This follows the rule that the same person cannot exist in two places at once. The event being taking up a place at a time.
    - Ex2: Getting one card that is a diamond. This means getting a heart, spade, or club did not happen.
  - Intersecting Events: Two events can occur at the same time.
    - Ex: Getting a diamond and getting a queen. The intersection point is the queen of diamonds. The part of Event A that is not part of the intersection is all other diamonds. The part of Event B that is not part of the intersection is all other queens.
  - Overlapping events: One event can only ever occur if the other one does as well
    - Ex: Drawing a red card and that card being a diamond. The diamond draw will only ever occur if a red card is drawn. If Event A is the red draw, any event that doesn't swallow Event B is drawing a heart.
    - If an outcome is NOT part of a SET, it CANNOT be part of any of its SUBSETS (diamond draw)
    - An outcome NOT being part of SOME subset does NOT EXCLUDE it from the entirety of the greater set (heart draw)
- Intersection of Sets || A Ω B = ø || A Ω B = QD || A Ω B = B
  - As described above, this is all the outcomes that are favourable for both A and B simultaneously
  - Intersection of ALL hearts and ALL diamonds is the EMPTY SET / NULL SET || A Ω B = ø
  - Intersection of a diamond and a queen is the queen of diamonds || A Ω B = QD
  - Intersection of a red card and a diamond would be ALL DIAMONDS || A Ω B = B
- Union of Sets || A U B
  - A combination of all outcomes preferred for either A or B
  - Ex: If USA is a union, a state is a set, and a citizen of that state is an element of both the union and set 
  - Null set intersection: A U B = A + B
    - No element is in both sets simultaneously, so we don't have to worry about double-counting
  - Intersection: A U B = A + B - A Ω B 
    - Can't double-count the intersect
  - Complete overlap: A U B = B + A - B or A
- Mutually Exclusive Sets
  - Sets which are not allowed to have any overlapping elements
  - Circles never intersect, so intersection is null set
  - Union or A U B = A + B
  - Sets have compliments: All values that are part of the sample space, but not part of the set
  - Compliment of all odd numbers is all even numbers
  - Compliments are ALWAYS mutually exclusive
  - NOT all mutually exclusive sets are compliments (think even numbers vs numbers ending in 5)
- Dependence and Independence of Sets
  - Independent events: theoretical probability remains unaffected by other events. Like flipping a coin, you always have 50% chance of heads or tails.
  - Dependent events: probabilities vary as conditions change. Like drawing a spade or a queen. Spade = 1/13 vs queen = 1/4
  - Conditional Probability: Probability of A given that B has occured || P(A|B)
    - Ex1: Probability of drwaing the Queen of Spades if we know the card is a SPADE is 1/13
    - Ex2: Probability of drwaing the Queen of Spades if we know the card is a QUEEN is 1/4
- The Conditional Probability Formula || P(A|B)
  - The likelihood of an event occuring, assuming a different one has already happened
  - Ex1: Two Coin Flips
    - P(A) = P(A|B)
    - If any two events are independent, P(A Ω B) = P(A) x P(B)
  - Ex2: Queen of Spades
    - A -> QS, B -> S, C -> Q
    - A -> QS == P(A) == 1/52
    - B -> S == P(A|B) == 1/13 || Dependent on A
    - C -> Q == P(A|B) == 1/4 || Dependent on A
    - P(A|B) = P(A Ω B) / P(B) ONLY IF B > 0
- The Additive Rule
  - P(A U B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A Ω B)

Section 10: Probability - Combinatorics

- Combinatorics deals with combinations of objects using a specified, finite set.
- Restrictions to the set can include repetition or order.
- Three parts of combinatorics which can be used to derive number of favorable outcomes or number of all elements in a sample space:
  - Permutations || P = n!
  - Variations || (rep) V = n ^ p || (w/o rep) V = n! / (n - p)!
  - Combinations || C = V / P || C = n! / p! (n - p)!
- Permutations: One of the most commonly used part of combinatorics || n!
  - Is the number of different possible ways we can arrange a set of elements
  - n -> n - 1 -> n - 2 ... 1 || formula: n!
  - n!
    - outliers: negative numbers do not have a factorial (must be natural), and 0! == 1
    - properties:
      - n! = n * (n-1)!
      - (n+1)! = n! * (n+1)
      - if n > k => 7! / 4! == 7 x 6 x 5 == 210
- Variations: The total number of ways we can pick and arrange some elements of a given set
    - example w/ repetition || V = n ^ p
      - forcing the lock open in RE2 used combinatorics to work through all variations until finding the opener
      - 3 letter lock, with 10 letters per slot, variations = 10^3 or 1000 variations
      - formula:
        - n = number of things to choose from (like letters)
        - p = number of slots to fill with choices
        - V = n^p
    - example w/o repetition || n! / (n - p)!
      - 5 runners to fill 4 relay spots
      - first spot has 5 options, second has 4, third has 3, fourth has 2
      - p = slots to fill
      - n = total number of choices
      - V = n! / (n - p)!
- Combinations: The number of ways we can pick certain elements of a set || C = (n! / (n - p)!) / n!
  - example: pick 3 people to represent your company at some event out of 10 total employees
  - formula:
    - C = V / P
    - C = n! / p! (n - p)!
    - C = 10! / 3! (10 - 3)!
    - C = (10 * 9 * 8) / (3 * 2 * 1) == 720 / 6 == 120
  - example: pick 4 people out of pool of 10
    - C = 10! / (4! (10 - 4)!) == (10 * 9 * 8 * 7) / (4 * 3 * 2 * 1) == 5040 / 24 == 210
- Symmetry of Combinations
  - example: you have 6 fruits, basket only fits 4
    - can pick 4 fruits to fit into the basket, OR
    - can pick 2 fruits to leave out
  - example: picking people to represent company
    - selection of 3 people to pick has the same combinations as picking 7 people
    - C = 10! / (7! (10 - 7)!) == 10! / 3! == (10 * 9 * 8) / (3 * 2 * 1) == 120
  
- VS
  - use variations over permutations when we are not arranging all elements in the sample space
  - variations don't take into account double counting elements, but combinations does. the number of variations of the relay would differ from the combinations because we could be rearranging the order (combinations) instead of having it be static once selected (variations)
  - * all the different permutations of a single combination are different variations
    - picking dave, alex, and steve is one variation, while picking alex, dave, and steve is another. but the combinatino of both is the same. and the total number of permutations is 6. so 1 combination, 6 variations, and 6 permutations
  - picking more elements leads to having fewer combinations

Basic principles of probability in data science:
- Trial vs experiment. A trial is an individual test with a recorded outcome. An experiment is a series of trials.
- How to calculate probability as an integer, with 0 being 0% and 1 being 100%.
- How to calculate frequency within probability. Used a 6x6 grid to reference two dice and frequency of die sums.
- Events and their compliments. How rolling a 5 on a 6-sided die has a probability of 0.167, whereas its compliment, 5' or not rolling a 5, has a probability of 0.83.

Topics today wrap up P1, the overview of the field of data science. For technology, Python and R are the big two programming languages that cover the different types of data science. Matlab (paid) and SQL are also two used across the board.

Worked through Sections 3 - 5 which primarily walked through the data science PDF. Moving from past to present on a timeline, we went over traditional and big data, when to apply it, why it's needed, techniques involved, where it's commonly found, tools used, and the job titles of those primarily focused on these steps.

Went over KPIs or "key performance indicators" as part of business intelligence techniques. Was first introduced to these at Brava. It's the process of filtering metrics that apply to business goals. This leads to BI reports and dashboards.

In the traditional methods bucket we took a look at linear regression and how observations can be charted and formulas can be created using y = bx. Another traditional methods is logistic regression, which is a binary representation. A third technique is cluster analysis, used when groupings are identifiable within a charted dataset. Finally, time-series data (think hourly, monthly, daily energy usage) illustrates behavior of usage over time.

In machine learning, deep learning is described as both supervised and unsupervised methods. One supervised method use case is fraud detection in financial industries. Think about traveling to a new country, and your credit card getting frozen because it's triggered some alert that the activity is outside the ML supervised model. Letting the credit card company know you are traveling opens up this model to interpret the activity as normal or expected.

As a whole, this course is very theory and video based. The quizzes are not terribly comprehensive. I'm looking forward to actually working through exercises.

Worked through Sections 1 and 2 of the course. These sections analysis vs analytics, different types of analytics and how they relate to business and data analytics, and when these different tools come into play when solving problems.o

Strictly speaking, analysis is a reflection on things that have happened, while analytics looks ahead for future projections base on the analysis data. Colloquially, however, "analytics" has become the umbrella term for both.

The separation of business analysis tools was rather interesting. It's broken up by analytics type under the "advanced analytics" umbrella, as well as using a time axis of past, present, and future.

Business Analytics is at the bottom of the stack, focusing primarily on business case studies in the past and qualitative analytics in the future. Then comes Data Science, which encompases preliminary data reporting in the past, and sales forecasting in the future. Data Analytics is largely represented by Data Science, but has a more pure form when looking strictly at data input and output to reach an improved setting.

The final three are Business Intelligence, Machine Learning, and AI. Business Intelligence relies on past and present analytics, with mechanisms like reporting with visuals and creating dashboards. This reminds me of something to prepare for a board meeting. It also overlaps with Machine Learning to create real-time dashboards.

Machine Learning is largely encompased with Data Science, and can be used to help wtih client retention and fraud prevention. Then this is tied in to AI, which primiarly uses Machine Learning to perform more advanced analytics.
